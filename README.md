## Installation
To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

The program will automatically begin asking questions about your team. It begins by asking for the manager's information. Once that is complete, you will be able to choose to add an engineer, intern, or complete your team. There are a different attribute of questions for the engineer and intern roles. Once you are done and select "I don't want to add any more team members", the program generates an HTML page that displays your team members in profile cards.
